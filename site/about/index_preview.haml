  ## Hi, I'm Brian Gonzalez.. 
  In 2007, I received my Bachelor's of Science in Electrical Engineering from [California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo](http://www.calpoly.edu/). 

  After graduation, I worked as a High School Youth Pastor at [FPCSLO](http://fpcslo.org/) for 3 years where I was able to spend time with teenage boys and girls and take groups of kids to serve the poor in Guatemala, the Dominican Republic, and Las Vegas.

  In 2011, my beautiful wife [Laura](http://los-gonzalez.com) and I moved to Norway where I pursued (and eventually received) my Master's Degree in Computer Science from the [University of Agder](http://www.uia.no/).


  ## Work
  I've worked for companies like [VMWare](http://vmware.com), [MyHeritage](http://myheritage.com), and [Geni](http://geni.com). I've created app/plugins/projects like [FontPrep](http://fontprep.com), [jquery.pep.js](http://pep.briangonzalez.org), [Sirkel](http://sirkel.cloudfoundry.com) ([featured](/jNQyF) on [The Next Web](http://www.thenextweb.com)), [Compass2CSS](http://c2c.briangonzalez.org), among others.
  

  ## I Believe
  - the web will win
  - people should be treated equally across the board
  - architect right the first time; iterate on bugs & features, not architecture
  - performance _is_ a feature, build accordingly
