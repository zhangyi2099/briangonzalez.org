  # Hi, I'm Brian Gonzalez.
  I have two loves: my wife and my westie (pictured below). When I am not hacking on some random or not-so-random web project, you can find me exploring California, playing basketball, _or_ hacking on some random web project.

  ## Me in a nutshell

  I have a degree in BSc in Electrical Engineering from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and a MSc in Computer Science from the University of Agder in Grimstad, Norway. I've traveled the world seeking to meet new people and lend a helping hand, if possible. I love getting outdoors and exploring, being active, and I also love using my hands to fix and make things. 

  ## What I'm about

  I am one of the web’s biggest proponents, and I enjoy using the web to build things that bring life to products and the  people that use them.  I geek out over clean Javascript, CSS animations and preprocessors, HTML5 APIs, and beautiful design.

  I am a veteran in respect to some skills, and a student in respect to others. I love to teach and be taught, and I also feel everyone should be treated equally across the board.

  ## Work
  I've worked for companies like [VMWare](http://vmware.com), [MyHeritage](http://myheritage.com), and [Geni](http://geni.com).  I've created apps/plugins/projects like [FontPrep](http://fontprep.com), [jquery.pep.js](http://pep.briangonzalez.org), [jquery.arbitrary-anchor.js](http://briangonzalez.org/arbitrary-anchor), Sirkel ([featured](/jNQyF) on The Next Web), [Compass2CSS](http://c2c.briangonzalez.org), among others.
