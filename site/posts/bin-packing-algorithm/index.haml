  The [Bin Packing Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bin_packing_problem) is a problem where objects with a given area must be packed into a finite number of bins with a given area such that the minimum amount of bins are used.

  I found [this article](http://codeincomplete.com/posts/2011/5/7/bin_packing/), which goes into detail about how to implement a Bin Packing algorithm in Javascript. The author used the algorithm to layout sprites on a sprite sheet. Pretty clever.

  Checkout this little demo below or [visit it](http://codepen.io/briangonzalez/pen/juGfr) directly.
