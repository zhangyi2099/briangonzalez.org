  [Dan Foreman-Mackey](http://dan.iel.fm/) has created such a neat tool: [The Open Source Report Card](http://osrc.dfm.io/).

  Check out [my Open Source Report Card](http://osrc.dfm.io/briangonzalez). Some notables: I am a _hump-day hero_, which means I do most of my work mid-week, and I also am _most productive in the morning_.

  Foreman-Mackey says it

  Noble goal my friend.
