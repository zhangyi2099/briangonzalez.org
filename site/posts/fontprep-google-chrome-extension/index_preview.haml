  We just released a [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fontprep/lgekjlpbdphfedjhdnebggommhalhake) for injecting [FontPrep](http://fontprep.com) fonts directly into any page.

  This is really useful because it allows you to inject a font and inspect how it looks on a page without needing to code _all of the fonts_ and _all of the CSS_ into the page.

  Before we start, make sure you have [FontPrep](http://fontprep.com) installed and have the [extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fontprep/lgekjlpbdphfedjhdnebggommhalhake)  downloaded. Here's a quick rundown on exactly how to use it.

  ## Step 1: Copy the font's ID

  First off, click on the name of the font to copy that font's ID to the clipboard. You'll be plugging this ID into the Chrome extension.

  ## Step 2: Paste in the ID and insert CSS selector

  Next, click on the extension's icon and paste in the font id and select which elements you'd like to apply the font to. You can use any valid CSS selector.

  ## Step 3: Apply font and styles
  Lastly, click apply and then low and behold, your font is applied to the given elements in the page.

  We'll be looking to extend the functionality of the extension over time. Hit me up on Twitter me with feature requests or any questions you may have.
