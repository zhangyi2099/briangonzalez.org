  I've been playing around with [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) loops lately and the cools things you can do with them. I know SASS is compiled down to CSS, but doing something like this in vanilla CSS would take a very long time.

  If you're not familiar with looping in SCSS, take a look at SCSS loops below:

      @for $i from 1 through 45{
        width: 5 * $i px;
      }
    {:lang=scss}
